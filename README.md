A modular Web Security Scanner built to analyze publicly accessible web applications and servers for common security issues. This project is designed as a learning-focused yet real-world–oriented tool, where features are added incrementally to understand how security scanners actually work under the hood.

Features:
Server Information Extraction
Detects server type (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

Port Scanning
Scans common ports to identify open services

Helps detect unnecessary exposed ports

CVE Version Fingerprinting
Attempts to fingerprint software versions
